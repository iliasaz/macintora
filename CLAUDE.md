# Agent guide for Swift and SwiftUI

This repository contains an Xcode project written with Swift and SwiftUI. Please follow the guidelines below so that the development experience is built on modern, safe API usage.

# Project Description
Macintora is a SQL IDE tool for Oracle databases. It is written for Developers by Developers. It offers the following main areas of functionality:
- SQL worksheet where a user can write and execute SQL, data grid, DBMS_OUTPUT results.
- Database Browser tool to browse and cache database objects like tables, packages, and etc.
- Connections manager where a user may choose a database connection, connect and disconnect from the database.

## Dependencies
- STTextView
- STTextView-Plugin-Neon
- STTextKitPlus
The dependencies are Swift SPM repositories that live next to the project directory. For example, STTextView repository is located in /Users/ilia/Developer/STTextView

## Core instructions

- Target macOS 26.0 or later. (Yes, it definitely exists.)
- Swift 6.2 or later, using modern Swift concurrency.
- SwiftUI backed up by `@Observable` classes for shared data.
- Do not introduce third-party frameworks without asking first.


## Swift instructions

### Approachable concurrency

This project uses Swift 6.2 approachable concurrency, which means:

- Code runs on the main actor by default (single-threaded).
- Nonisolated async functions run on the caller's actor by default, not the global executor.
- Use `@concurrent` to explicitly run async functions on the concurrent thread pool when parallelism is needed.
- Do not manually mark classes with `@MainActor` unless they need to be isolated from default main actor context.
- Rely on the compiler's automatic `@Sendable` inference from captures.

### General Swift guidelines

- Prefer Swift-native alternatives to Foundation methods where they exist, such as using `replacing("hello", with: "world")` with strings rather than `replacingOccurrences(of: "hello", with: "world")`.
- Prefer modern Foundation API, for example `URL.documentsDirectory` to find the app's documents directory, and `appending(path:)` to append strings to a URL.
- Never use C-style number formatting such as `Text(String(format: "%.2f", abs(myNumber)))`; always use `Text(abs(change), format: .number.precision(.fractionLength(2)))` instead.
- Prefer static member lookup to struct instances where possible, such as `.circle` rather than `Circle()`, and `.borderedProminent` rather than `BorderedProminentButtonStyle()`.
- Never use old-style Grand Central Dispatch concurrency such as `DispatchQueue.main.async()`. If behavior like this is needed, always use modern Swift concurrency.
- Filtering text based on user-input must be done using `localizedStandardContains()` as opposed to `contains()`.
- Avoid force unwraps and force `try` unless it is unrecoverable.


## SwiftUI instructions

- Always use `foregroundStyle()` instead of `foregroundColor()`.
- Always use `clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius:))` instead of `cornerRadius()`.
- Always use the `Tab` API instead of `tabItem()`.
- Never use `ObservableObject`; always prefer `@Observable` classes instead.
- Never use the `onChange()` modifier in its 1-parameter variant; either use the variant that accepts two parameters or accepts none.
- Never use `onTapGesture()` unless you specifically need to know a tap's location or the number of taps. All other usages should use `Button`.
- Never use `Task.sleep(nanoseconds:)`; always use `Task.sleep(for:)` instead.
- Never use `UIScreen.main.bounds` to read the size of the available space.
- Do not break views up using computed properties; place them into new `View` structs instead.
- Do not force specific font sizes; prefer using Dynamic Type instead.
- Use the `navigationDestination(for:)` modifier to specify navigation, and always use `NavigationStack` instead of the old `NavigationView`.
- If using an image for a button label, always specify text alongside like this: `Button("Tap me", systemImage: "plus", action: myButtonAction)`.
- When rendering SwiftUI views, always prefer using `ImageRenderer` to `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`.
- Don't apply the `fontWeight()` modifier unless there is good reason. If you want to make some text bold, always use `bold()` instead of `fontWeight(.bold)`.
- Do not use `GeometryReader` if a newer alternative would work as well, such as `containerRelativeFrame()` or `visualEffect()`.
- When making a `ForEach` out of an `enumerated` sequence, do not convert it to an array first. So, prefer `ForEach(x.enumerated(), id: \.element.id)` instead of `ForEach(Array(x.enumerated()), id: \.element.id)`.
- When hiding scroll view indicators, use the `.scrollIndicators(.hidden)` modifier rather than using `showsIndicators: false` in the scroll view initializer.
- Place view logic into view models or similar, so it can be tested.
- Avoid `AnyView` unless it is absolutely required.
- Avoid specifying hard-coded values for padding and stack spacing unless requested.
- Avoid using UIKit colors in SwiftUI code.



## Logging instructions

- For iOS/macOS applications, always use Apple's unified logging system with `OSLog`:
  - Import `OSLog` (not `os.log`)
  - Create loggers with `Logger(subsystem:category:)`
  - Use appropriate log levels: `.debug`, `.info`, `.notice`, `.error`, `.fault`
  - Example: `private let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.newscomb.app", category: "networking")`
- For cross-platform or server-side Swift applications, use [apple/swift-log](https://github.com/apple/swift-log) instead
- Never use `print()` statements for logging in production code
- Include relevant context in log messages but avoid logging sensitive data


## Testing instructions

- **Always** write unit tests for logic changes (services, view models, algorithms, models). No task is complete without tests.
- **Always** write and execute tests for any functional change before declaring it done. Do not skip this step — code that compiles but isn't tested is not finished.
- **Always** write UI tests when unit tests are not possible for UI-specific behavior.
- **Always** run the relevant test suite after writing tests and verify all tests pass before declaring any task complete.
- Run tests with: `xcodebuild test -scheme NewsCombApp -destination 'platform=macOS'`
- Place test files in the `NewsCombAppTests/` directory, matching the source file structure.
- Use `XCTest` for all tests. Do not use third-party test frameworks without asking first.
- Test pure logic in isolation — avoid depending on the live database or network in unit tests.
- For database operations, create an in-memory `DatabaseQueue` in tests to avoid depending on the live database.
- SQLite functions differ from other databases. Always verify SQL compatibility (e.g., SQLite lacks `LOG()`, `POWER()`, and many aggregate functions). Prefer computing in Swift when in doubt.


## Git workflow

- When creating releases, always use `gh release list` to determine the latest version number. Never use `git tag` for this purpose, as tags from dependency packages or other conventions may produce incorrect results.

## PR instructions

- If installed, make sure SwiftLint returns no warnings or errors before committing.
